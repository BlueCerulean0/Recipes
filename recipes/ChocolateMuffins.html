        <p>Chocolate chocolate chip muffins are a chocolate lover’s dream. The rich, cocoa-infused batter creates a deep, velvety base that’s filled with sweet, melty chocolate chips, giving each bite a burst of indulgence. The slightly crisp top contrasts with the soft, moist interior, making them an irresistible treat.</p>

The cocoa provides a robust, almost bittersweet foundation, while the chocolate chips add just the right amount of sweetness and a touch of chewiness. Together, they create a harmony that’s both satisfying and comforting.</p>
        
        <p>Perfect for any time of day, whether as a breakfast companion to your coffee or a late-night snack, chocolate chocolate chip muffins are as versatile as they are delicious. Their decadent yet simple nature makes them a timeless favorite, offering pure enjoyment with every bite.</p>

    <h2><em><u>Ingredients:</u></em></h2>

    <ul>

        <li>6 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>¾ cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>

    </ul>

    <h2><em><u>Directions:</u></em></h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the semisweet chocolate together with the butter. Let stand until cooled, about 10 minutes.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Lightly beat the egg. In a small bowl, stir together the chocolate-butter mixture with the buttermilk, sugar, egg, and vanilla, until blended well.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        In a large bowl, stir together flour, soda, and salt. Make a hole in the center of the dry ingredients, pour in the chocolate mixture, and stir until just combined. Stir in the mini chocolate chips. Spoon the batter into the lined muffin cups.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Remove muffin tin from oven and let stand at least 5 minutes, before removing the muffins and letting them cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or cooled; can be frozen as well.
