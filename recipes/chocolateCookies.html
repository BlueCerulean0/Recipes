    <h2><em><u>Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients:</u></em></h2>
    
    <p>These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe:</p>
    <ul>
    
        <li><b>Sugar</b>: The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar.</li>
        <li><b>Butter</b>: Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>: Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together. </li>
        <li><b>Vanilla</b>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies. </li>
        <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.</li>
        <li><b>Cocoa powder</b>: They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!</li>
        <li><b>Baking soda</b>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise. </li>
        <li><b>Salt</b>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty. </li>
        <li><b>Chocolate chips</b>: You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips. </li>
        <li><b>Walnuts (optional)</b>: Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch. </li>

    </ul>


    <h2><em><u><b>How to Make Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies:</b></u></em></h2>
    
    <p>
        You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below – but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make the best chocolate chocolate chip cookies of your life:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Beat the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another. </li>
        <li>Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, then stir in the chocolate chips and nuts.</li>
        <li>Drop the dough onto baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are set.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><em><u><b>How to Store Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies:</b></u></em></h2>
    <p>
        Store the cooled chocolate chocolate chip cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. To ensure the cookies stay soft, you might want to throw in a slice of white bread – it’ll absorb the excess moisture. 
    </p>

    <h2><em><u><b>Can You Freeze Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies?:</b></u></em></h2>
    <p>
        Yes! You can freeze baked chocolate chocolate chip cookies and chocolate chocolate chip cookie dough.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>To freeze baked cookies</b>: Allow the baked cookies to cool completely. Arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet, cover, and freeze for about three hours or up to overnight. Transfer the now-frozen cookies to a zip-top bag or freezer-safe container. Wrap in at least one layer of foil for extra protection. Freeze for up to two months.</li>
        <li><b>To freeze cookie dough</b>: Drop balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and freeze for about three hours or up to overnight. Transfer the frozen cookies to a zip-top bag or freezer-safe container. Wrap in at least one layer of foil for extra protection. Freeze for up to two months.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><em><u><b>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise:</b></u></em></h2>

    <p>
        “Great recipe just as written,” according to one Allrecipes community member. “Whenever a cookie recipe calls for butter I always chill the dough for an hour or so before baking as this prevents a flat cookie. The taste of butter can't be beat!”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Unbelievably good,” raves Mandi McBride Jensen. “Soft, chewy, a tiny bit crispy on the edges, perfect chocolate richness. I won’t freely admit to how quickly my son and I devoured an entire batch.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “These were so easy to make and they were delicious,” says another Allrecipes community member. “I chopped up Andes mints to substitute the chocolate chips and they were so good!!”
